1. Why did you choose this dataset?
 - I chose the Game and Grade dataset because, as a gamer myself, I wanted to see if having higher play hours would lead to a decrease in grades
(which it actually did). 

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?
- In the single regression model, it showed that having more playing hours leads to a decrease in grades,
while in the multiple regression model where all factors were included, it showed an improvement, 
though there was still some questionable variance.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?'
 - Linear regression is very relevant today and will continue to be in the days to come. Why? 
It provides clear, understandable relationships between variables. It also provides actionable insights 
and gives junior devs a taste of and foundation for machine learning.
